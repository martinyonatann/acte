## Project Details

### Billing Engine for Loan Management
The billing engine manages and tracks loans, providing features such as loan schedules, outstanding balances, and delinquency status for a 50-week loan with a 10% annual interest rate.

### Reconciliation Service
The reconciliation service identifies unmatched and discrepant transactions between internal data (system transactions) and external data (bank statements).

### Loan Service
The loan service will be designed to manage loan-related operations, including loan creation, payment processing, and tracking.

### Postman with Example Response
Postman is used for testing the API endpoints with example responses to ensure correct functionality and integration.

### Configuration Management
- **Viper**: Used for managing configuration settings across different environments.
